# mr_ml_boilerplate

A Cookiecutter template for quickly setting up a basic machine learning project with best practices, modular structure, and reproducibility.

## Requirements

- [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):  

  Install via pip if you don't have it:
  ```bash
  pip install cookiecutter
  ```

## Usage

### 1. Create a New Project Using This Template

You can use either the GitHub HTTPS URL or your local path:

**From GitHub:**
```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/Mathanraj-Sharma/mr_ml_boilerplate.git
```

**From a Local Path (if you have cloned the repo):**
```bash
cookiecutter path/to/mr_ml_boilerplate
```

You will be prompted to enter some information about your new project (such as project name, author, etc.).

### 2. Project Structure

Your new project will look like:

```
your_project_name/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ raw/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ processed/
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ validation.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.py
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.py
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore
```
## ðŸ“¦ Tracking Empty Folders with `.gitkeep`

Git does not track empty folders. To ensure critical directories like `models/`, `data/raw/`, and `data/processed/` are preserved in version control (even if initially empty), this template includes `.gitkeep` files inside them.

- `models/.gitkeep`: Placeholder to keep the directory for saved models.
- `data/raw/.gitkeep`: Placeholder to indicate where raw data should be placed.
- `data/processed/.gitkeep`: Placeholder for processed datasets.

You can safely delete these `.gitkeep` files once the directories contain actual files.

## Customization

- Update `requirements.txt` with your dependencies.
- Add custom scripts and notebooks to the respective directories.
- Modify or extend the Makefile for your workflow.
